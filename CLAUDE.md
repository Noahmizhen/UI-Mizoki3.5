# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Context

## Project Overview

**MIZ OKI 3.5** is a Verifiable Autonomous Decision Intelligence Platform. This repository contains the marketing website deployed on Google Cloud Run.

## Architecture

- **Deployment**: Docker container on Google Cloud Run
- **Web Server**: Python Flask application served via Gunicorn
- **Domain**: mizoki3.com (Cloud Run custom domain)
- **Routing**: Client and API routes managed natively in Flask (`app.py`)

## Core Technology (7-Stage SRDPV-DAL Pipeline)

```
SENSE → REASON → PLAN → VALIDATE → DECIDE → ACT → LEARN
```

Key innovations:
- Decision Control Plane (DCP)
- Validation & Arbitration Layer
- Counterfactual Simulation Engine
- Temporal-Causal Knowledge Graph (TCO-KG)

## Recent Work (March 2026)

### Boss Agent & MCP Integration
- Added a concrete Boss Agent runtime with MCP-style tool registration, skill memory, and decision traces in `mizoki_runtime/runtime.py`.
- Exposed discovery and execution endpoints through Flask (`/api/mcp/*`, `/api/boss/*`).
- Added a graph-native decision intelligence layer in `mizoki_runtime/runtime.py` that runs SRPVDAL with GraphRAG retrieval, KG grounding, counterfactual simulation, and subagent recommendations.
- Added direct graph-native APIs at `/api/boss/graph/subagents`, `/api/boss/graph/context`, `/api/boss/graph/simulate`, and `/api/boss/graph/loop`.
- Added loop-to-skill promotion through `skills.learn_from_loop` and `/api/boss/skills/learn-from-loop`.
- Synchronized deployment and control planes across Cells 1-34.
- Handled merging of sub-PRs for pipeline correction and UI optimization.
- Addressed Google Cloud networking by repointing the Global External HTTPS Load Balancer (`mizoki-lb`) to a new Serverless Network Endpoint Group (NEG) hooked to the canonical `mizoki-website` Cloud Run deployment, securing a single source of truth.

### Integration Note
- Prior planning referenced `boss_agent_core.py` and external MCP registration blocks from a different repository shape.
- In this repo, the actual Boss/KG/GraphRAG integration point is the Flask runtime in `mizoki_runtime/runtime.py` plus the API layer in `app.py`.
- Any future graph-native or Boss-agent work should land there unless this repository gains the separate agent-service layout.

### Review-Driven Corrections
- Fixed routing bugs caused by substring matching so `decision control plane` no longer incorrectly maps to the `plan` stage.
- Constrained skill and alias learning inference so the Boss Agent does not accidentally route normal explanation requests into `skills.learn` or `tools.register_alias`.
- Added bounded integer validation for `top_k` and trace limits.
- Hardened trace and alias loading so malformed JSONL or alias records do not break startup or trace inspection.
- Added discovery metadata describing learning tools, tool-learning tools, and routing behaviors so the Boss Agent is more explicit about its capabilities.
- Added loop-aware learning behavior:
  - `skills.learn_from_loop` promotes graph-native loop traces into reusable skills.
  - If a user asks to learn from a loop before any loop exists, the Boss Agent should prefer generating a loop first.

### Why These Changes Were Made
- The initial task history mixed this website repository with a different multi-agent Python service layout.
- The real goal here was not to document graph-native decision intelligence conceptually, but to make the local Boss runtime actually usable, discoverable, and safe.
- The review phase therefore focused on closing the gap between “tools exist” and “the Boss Agent uses them correctly with the right parameters and the right sequencing.”

### Current Verification Standard
- `python3 -m py_compile mizoki_runtime/runtime.py app.py`
- `python3 -m unittest tests.test_runtime tests.test_app`
- Current regression coverage for this implementation path: 25 passing tests

### Canonical Blog Routing via Flask
Migrated legacy subdomain-dependent blogs to canonical main-domain paths internally using Python/Flask (`app.py`):
- Stripped all meta-refresh `blogs.html` redirections to external domains, pointing them 301 to `/blog/`.
- Configured dynamic, extensionless URL resolving for `relu-lens-meta-algorithm`.
- Added legacy redirect fallbacks for slugs like `meta-relu-gate-go-deep-before-wide`.
- Consolidated article static paths and structure exclusively under `/blog`.
